# Picture-Mood-Playlist 

Have you ever thought that for some moments in your life you needed the right soundtrack?
This is the app for you!
You can provide us with a picture that represents your mood and we will create a Spotify playlist inspired by your image that conveys the same mood as the image.

## Introduction

This is the project for the CPAC course, we are Filippo, Jiayan and Haokun (Group7). We created a program that allows users to upload a local photo, or take a photo, then analyze it to return the user's favorite songs in their Spotify account.
